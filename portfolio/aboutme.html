            I have colorful petals of visions, creativity, optimistic approach and fragrance of passion to convert imagines into reality.
            I am rooted in the flower pot of DATA SCIENCE and determined to bloom with flying colors of innovations by analyzing the Data Science.
            I also have varying petals of art and craft including my hobby of doing NAIL ARTS in leisure times. I own an Instagram account named as nakshimnails, where I come across different people in the community throughout the world.
            In college, apart from studies I keep myself entertained by indulging into art and craft work.
